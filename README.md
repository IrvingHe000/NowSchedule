# Nowschedule


### Proposed Level of Achievement: 
Vostok

### Target Audience: 
University students (especially NUS students)

### Motivation:
There are a lot of applications that can help people schedule their timetable, but during our daily use, we found that it is hard to find an application that contains every function that we want. For example, we want to record our tasks and deadlines (Microsoft to do), and also want an app that can help us to schedule our classes (NUSmods). However, both of these two applications have their limitation: users cannot see their tasks from a graph timetable directly from Microsoft to do, while they also cannot import their tasks into NUSmods. In addition, there are also some other functionality that we think are important, for example, help to plan teamwork when people make their schedule. Therefore, we plan to build a web application containing functionalities that we think are useful to users.

### User Stories:
1. As a student who has different classes to attend every day, I want to check the days, times, and venues of classes from an app.

2. As a student who always has some important tasks, such as exams and CAs, I want to be able to record and check the time or deadline of each task conveniently, and also update the task when I receive a new task or finish some of them.

3. As a student who collaborates with my classmate frequently, I want to know the time when my teammates and I are both free so that we can make a schedule for our teamwork.

### Functionality:
- Allow users to record important tasks or events, such as deadlines, exam days, and reminding users when the important day is closed.
- Allow NUS users to check and select the times, venues of their modules.
- Presenting users' tasks and events as a graphical timetable.
- Allow a group of users finding their common free time in order to help them arrange meetings.

### Plan:
- 1st week of June: A basic login in system
- 2nd week of June: The main interface of the website
- 3rd week of June: Basic functionality of the website, including recording and presenting data that users import
- 4th week of June: Testing and debuging
- 1st week of July: Implementation of peer teamsâ€™ suggestions
- 2nd week of July: Implementation of the team-work functionality
- 3rd week of July: Testing and debugging
- 4th week of July: Final enhancement
